# CloudMusic

CloudMusic is a competitor for Google Music and Spotify. It is a paid music service. Contrary to these and other cloud music players, Cloud Music provides an API and a way to create your own music player on top of the service, that also works in the cloud. So you can choose various music players depending on your needs. If you want something more than lame, extremely basic music player that does not care about your playlist music order, you can choose other one that does. Without changing service provider every time, or having to set up your own music service.
